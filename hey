Hey this is Nikhil here and to be completely honest I'm so fucking tired of this love stuff.
Two three years back if you'd asked what i would ask for if a genie appeared in front of me
i guess one of my answers would've been immortality,but recent years have taught me that 
infinit life is just rubbish,when i hear people tell me that i have to live for my parents
i feel like I'm doing a stupid thing,cause I never wanted t live for my parents,to be honest 
I feel like I've been living the past few years just so that I wished to confront Dona about my feelings
for her,when I think of death,I feel I'm not ready cause I've got a few things left unsaid and
yes I know confessing a girl you're deeply in love with being the only reason to live seems
kinda cringy,especially when you are only 18 years of age and is yet to explore the world,I mean
come on college is just the first step towards exploring the real world.And yes Iknow that mst teenagers find
his girl when he's entered my age,and since I started college I've been on a quest,but everytime I
feel like I'm inching towards victory I feel like I've already found the treasure,but I'm refraining myself to
confront that treasure.The fever last week really was a turning point,cause it made me realize how much I 
was in love with her.I was so prepared to leave for bangalore but then fever cam by and me thinking that 
this was the only thing I had to tell my friends for what I did during my holidays and that I was never gonna 
get another chance to go to bangalore in the near future,so I decided to leave for Bangalore,and tbh it was an
amaazing trip,but then I came back hoping that Dona was going to ask something about where I'd been all week
but it seemed like that she never did even notice that I'd left,so my parents think that my gloominess has
got something to do with my bangalore trip but tbh she not requesting to be my friend on snapchat and not
accepting my friend request while she's still sending snaps to my friends and just avoiding me is the entire
fuckin reason for my current mood.I just shared a few angry messages with Citto,but I know he can't help me 
with this and tomorrow I won't be able to see her cause I've got this stupid baptism coming up which is unavoidable
but days are going by so fuckin fast and not being able to talk to her is definitely not helping out.So tomorrow
i'm setting out early morning seeking for an oppr
heyyy
